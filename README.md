# BIOL-7180-CLASS-PROJECT
## About this Project:
This is a class project for BIOL7830-a graduate-level course designed to help biologists and other life-scientists get comfortable at coding.
## Function
This repo contains a python script that enables one to search online stores in the USA for PS5, the latest console in the Playstation series.
The srcipt is dynamic and allows users to input their email; where they receive notification when a game is available online.
The script can also buy the game for the user, if the option is enabled.
